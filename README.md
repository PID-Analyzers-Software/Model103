# Portable Gas Analyzer Model 103 Software Development

## To-Do List

1. **Define Software Architecture:**
   - Outline the overall structure and design principles for the Menu Software (Version 121023) and associated modules.

2. **Setup Development Environment:**
   - Establish a development environment with necessary tools, libraries, and frameworks for firmware development.

3. **Implement PID Operating Software:**
   - Develop the core PID functionality for both channels (0-500 ppm and 0-5,000 ppm) with optional configurations for different ranges.

4. **Keypad and Menu Navigation Implementation:**
   - Interpret signals from the 4-position keypad and implement functionality for menu navigation (MODE, Up Arrow, Down Arrow, Select).

5. **Display Integration:**
   - Interface with the 2.4‚Äù OLED display to present relevant information, configurations, and menu options.

6. **Configuration Options Software:**
   - Develop software to support different configurations: PID ppm, PID ppm & ppb optional, PID and Compound Specific modes.

7. **Calibration Software Development:**
   - Create a calibration menu with options for zero calibration, calibration gas value adjustment, and calibration gas selection.

8. **Alarm System Implementation:**
   - Develop software to set alarm values and control the activation or deactivation of alarms through the menu.

9. **Log Menu Software Implementation:**
   - Implement manual and automatic logging of gas concentration data with options for turning off logging.

10. **Setup Software Development:**
    - Develop software for configuring time parameters and setting background zero (BKG Zero) for baseline correction.

11. **Power Management Implementation:**
    - Implement efficient power management to maximize battery life and monitor battery status.

12. **Exit Menu Software Development:**
    - Develop functionality to safely exit the menu system and transition to standby or power-off modes.

13. **Error Handling Implementation:**
    - Implement robust error handling to manage unexpected events or user input and display clear error messages.

14. **User Interface Software Development:**
    - Design and implement a cohesive and user-friendly interface that integrates all menu options seamlessly.

15. **Documentation Preparation:**
    - Prepare comprehensive documentation for end-users and maintenance personnel, covering software functionalities, calibration procedures, and troubleshooting steps.

16. **Testing and Debugging:**
    - Conduct thorough testing of each software module, addressing any bugs or issues identified during the testing phase.

17. **Integration Testing:**
    - Ensure seamless integration of all software components and validate overall system functionality.

18. **Firmware Update Mechanism:**
    - Implement a mechanism for firmware updates, ensuring the device can be easily updated with the latest software.

19. **Final Testing and Quality Assurance:**
    - Conduct a final round of testing to ensure the software meets all requirements and quality standards.

20. **Deployment:**
    - Prepare the finalized software for deployment onto the Portable Gas Analyzer Model 103.

21. **Post-Deployment Support:**
    - Provide ongoing support for users, addressing any issues that may arise after deployment.
